Basic unit testing

Unit testing a graph application

  The basic pattern of unit testing with Neo4j is illustrated by the <<<Neo4jBasicTest.java>>> test.

  Before each test, create a fresh database, deleting any pre-existing files:

%{source-code|snippet=beforeTest|file=src/test/java/org/neo4j/examples/Neo4jBasicTest.java}

  File cleanup could happen here instead, but that would miss the opporunity to inspect the 
  database after a test run. Instead, just shutdown the database:

%{source-code|snippet=afterTest|file=src/test/java/org/neo4j/examples/Neo4jBasicTest.java}

  During a test, create nodes and check to see that they are there, being careful to enclose
  write operations in a transaction.

%{source-code|snippet=unitTest|file=src/test/java/org/neo4j/examples/Neo4jBasicTest.java}
